## ü§ñ AI Agents

### Sommelier Agent
- Provides wine analysis
- Suggests food pairings
- Ensures wine and food harmony

### Chef Agent
- Creates menu suggestions
- Considers flavor combinations
- Designs cohesive menu progression

## üìù Notes

- The application requires an active internet connection for AI agent functionality
- OpenAI API usage may incur charges based on your account plan
- Response times may vary based on API load and complexity of suggestions

## üîí Security

- Never commit your `.env` file or expose your API keys
- The application uses environment variables for sensitive data
- Always use a virtual environment to manage dependencies

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# OpenAI API Key for GPT models
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Authentication Configuration
AUTHORIZED_EMAILS=email1@domain.com,email2@domain.com
AUTHORIZED_DOMAINS=company1.com,company2.com
```

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for accessing GPT models
- `AUTHORIZED_EMAILS`: Comma-separated list of email addresses that can access the app
- `AUTHORIZED_DOMAINS`: Comma-separated list of email domains that can access the app (use "none" if not using domain-based auth)

### Authentication

The app uses Streamlit's built-in authentication system when deployed to Streamlit Cloud. Authentication behavior:

- **Local Development**: 
  - Authentication is bypassed
  - A warning message appears in the sidebar
  - All features are accessible

- **Deployed (Streamlit Cloud)**:
  - Users must log in via Streamlit's authentication
  - Access is restricted to authorized emails/domains specified in `.env`
  - Unauthorized users will see an error message

To enable authentication when deploying:
1. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
2. Go to your app's settings
3. Under "Security & Privacy"
4. Enable "Require users to authenticate"

## üõ† mini_app_no_crewai.py Overview

The `mini_app_no_crewai.py` is a streamlined version of the Dinner Party Planner application that focuses solely on wine analysis without the complexity of orchestrating multiple AI agents. This version utilizes the OpenAI API to provide detailed wine analysis based on user input.

### üåü Application Flow

1. **User Input**:
   - The user enters the name of a wine they wish to analyze.
   - The input is captured using Streamlit's text input widget.

2. **Wine Analysis**:
   - Upon clicking the "Analyze Wine" button, the app creates an instance of the [WineAnalyzerTool](cci:2://file:///Users/ngates/Code/python/dinner-party-planner/mini_app.py:46:0-98:17).
   - This tool is responsible for interacting with the OpenAI API to fetch wine analysis.

3. **OpenAI API Interaction**:
   - The [WineAnalyzerTool](cci:2://file:///Users/ngates/Code/python/dinner-party-planner/mini_app.py:46:0-98:17) sends a request to the OpenAI API, utilizing the function calling feature to analyze the wine.
   - The request includes predefined schemas that specify the expected output format, including characteristics, pairing suggestions, and serving recommendations.

4. **Response Handling**:
   - The app receives a structured response from the OpenAI API, which includes the analysis results.
   - The response is parsed, and validation is performed to ensure all required fields are present.

5. **Display Results**:
   - The analyzed results are displayed to the user in a structured format, including:
     - Characteristics of the wine
     - Suggested food pairings
     - Serving recommendations
   - The user can also click the "Start Over" button to reset the application state.

### üõ† Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12+**: The core programming language for the application.
- **Streamlit**: A web application framework used for building the user interface.
- **OpenAI API**: Powers the wine analysis functionality, providing detailed insights based on user input.
- **python-dotenv**: Manages environment variables for secure API key handling.
- **Pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management.

### ü§ñ OpenAI API Features

- **Function Calling**: The application leverages the OpenAI API's function calling capability to provide structured responses. This allows the model to return data in a predefined format, ensuring that all necessary information is included in the response.
- **Inputs**:
  - Wine name entered by the user.
- **Outputs**:
  - A structured JSON response containing:
    - `characteristics`: A detailed description of the wine.
    - `pairing_suggestions`: Recommendations for food that pairs well with the wine.
    - `serving_recommendations`: Suggestions for serving temperature and glass type.

### üì¶ OpenAI API Response Format

When the application makes a request to the OpenAI API using the function calling feature, it receives a structured response that includes various components. Below is an example of such a response:

```
ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-Ar2jR4YGR0WiDbr7pKunWP7n0MtVI', 
choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, 
message=ChatCompletionMessage(content=None, role='assistant', 
function_call=FunctionCall(arguments='{"characteristics":"The 2018 Caymus Cabernet Sauvignon is a rich and opulent wine with deep purple color. It offers enticing aromas of dark fruit, blackberries, cassis, and hints of vanilla and oak. On the palate, it is full-bodied with velvety tannins and flavors of ripe black cherries, plums, and a touch of spice. The wine has a long, smooth finish with a lingering presence of fruit and oak.","pairing_suggestions":"This Cabernet Sauvignon pairs beautifully with grilled meats such as ribeye steak, lamb chops, or a hearty beef stew. It also goes well with aged cheddar cheese or dark chocolate.","serving_recommendations":"Serve this wine at around 60-65¬∞F (15-18¬∞C) to bring out its full flavors. Decanting is recommended to allow the wine to breathe and open up. Use a large, tulip-shaped glass to enhance the aromas and flavors of the wine."}', name='analyze_wine'), tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], 
created=1737205249, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', 
system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=206,
